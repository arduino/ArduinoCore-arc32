  MIDI note player

  This sketch shows how to use the serial transmit pin (pin 1) to send MIDI note data.
  If this circuit is connected to a MIDI synth, it will play
  the notes F#-0 (0x1E) to F#-5 (0x5A) in sequence.


  The circuit:
   digital in 1 connected to MIDI jack pin 5
   MIDI jack pin 2 connected to ground
   MIDI jack pin 4 connected to +5V through 220-ohm resistor
  Attach a MIDI cable to the jack, then to a MIDI synth, and play music.

  // play notes from F#-0 (0x1E) to F#-5 (0x5A):

    //Note on channel 1 (0x90), some note value (note), middle velocity (0x45):
    noteOn(0x90, note, 0x45);
    delay(100);
    //Note on channel 1 (0x90), some note value (note), silent velocity (0x00):
    noteOn(0x90, note, 0x00);
    delay(100);
  }
}

//  plays a MIDI note.  Doesn't check to see that
//  cmd is greater than 127, or that data values are  less than 127:
void noteOn(int cmd, int pitch, int velocity) {
  midiSerial.write(cmd);
  midiSerial.write(pitch);
  midiSerial.write(velocity);
}
