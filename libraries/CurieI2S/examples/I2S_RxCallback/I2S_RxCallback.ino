/**
 * A simple sketch to test the rx channel of the i2s interface. 
 * A callback function is used to fill up a buffer whenever data is received
 * 
 * To test this sketch you will need a second Arduino/Genuino 101 board with the I2S_TxCallback sketch uploaded
 * 
 * Connection:
 *   I2S_RSCK(pin 8) -> I2S_TSCK(pin 2) 
 *   I2S_RWS (pin 3) -> I2S_TWS (pin 4)
 *   I2S_RXD (pin 5) -> I2S_TXD (pin 7)
 *   Ground  (GND)   -> Ground  (GND)
 * Notes:
 *   Transmission is sensitive to noise. To reduce noise:
 *   - Power both boards with an external power supply. Usb power is not always clean.
 *   - Insure that both boards are sharing the same ground.
 *   - Use short wires to connect between the board or use shielded wire.
