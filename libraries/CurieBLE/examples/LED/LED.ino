  This example can work with LEDCentral

  This example is similar to CallbackLED example in functionality.
  It does not use callbacks. In the loop it interogates the connection state with central.
  Checks if the characteristic is written and turns the LED on or off accordingly.
  To test interactively, use a phone app like nrf Controller (Android) or Light Blue (iOS).
  Connect to BLE device named LED and explore characteristic with UUID 19B10001-E8F2-537E-4F6C-D104768A1214.
  Writing a byte value such as 0x40 should turn on the LED.
  Writing a byte value of 0x00 should turn off the LED.
