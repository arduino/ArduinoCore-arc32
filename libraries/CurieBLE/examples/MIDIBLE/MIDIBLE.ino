   MIDI over BLE info from: https://developer.apple.com/bluetooth/Apple-Bluetooth-Low-Energy-MIDI-Specification.pdf

  This sketch plays a random MIDI note (between 0 and 127) every 400ms.
  For a 'smarter' sketch, check out my Airpeggiator example.
  The Airpeggiator uses the Curie's IMU to allow you to play
  an imaginary harp in the air. I included a quantizer so you can
  select a key and scale so you can jam along with friends.

  I have only tested MIDI over BLE using Apple devices. Android doesn't
  support native MIDI over BLE yet and I haven't had much of a chance
  to test with Windows machines.

  To connect on a Mac, search for Audio MIDI Setup.
  Click 'Window' on the top menu and choose 'Show MIDI Studio'.
  Double click 'Bluetooth' and the bluetooth configuration window
  will pop up. After loading the MIDIBLE sketch on your Arduino 101
  you should see it advertising as Auxren. Click connect and the device
  will be available as MIDI device in all your audio software like Garageband.

  There are a few ways to connect using an iOS device. One way to to open
  up Garageband. Click on the wrench icon in the upper right and choose 'Advanced'
  Towards the bottom of advanced, you will see 'Bluetooth MIDI devices'.
  You should see your Arduino 101 advertising in the list. Connect to
  your device and it should be available to all other iOS MIDI apps you have.

  To send data, you use the following line: char.setValue(d, n); where char is
  the BLE characteristic (in our case, midiCha), d is the data, and n is the
  number of bytes of data.
  The first 2 bytes of data are the header byte and timestamp byte. If you want,
  you can figure out the timestamping scheme, but I just left it with a generic value
  since I haven't worked on anything timeing sensitive yet (like a sequencer).
  The third, fourth, and fifth bytes are standard MIDI bytes. You can send more bytes
  if you would like as long as it is complies to the standard MIDI spec.
