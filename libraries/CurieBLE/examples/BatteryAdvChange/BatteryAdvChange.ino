/* Please see code copyright at the bottom of this example code */

/*
  This example can work with phone BLE app.

  This sketch illustrates how to change the advertising data so that it is visible but not
  connectable. Then after 10 seconds it changes to being connectable.
  This sketch example partially implements the standard Bluetooth Low-Energy Battery service.

  This sketch is not paired with a specific central example sketch,
  but to see how it works you need to use a BLE APP on your phone or central device
  and try connecting when it is either a connectable or not connectable state
  as displayed in the serial monitor.
