 * BLE CONFIGURATION
 *
 * If you are using an Arduino 101, you do not need to make any changes to this file (unless you
 * need a unique ble local name (see below). If you are using another supported BLE board or shield,
 * follow the instructions for the specific board or shield below.
 *
 * Make sure you have the Intel Curie Boards package v1.0.6 or higher installed via the Arduino
 * Boards Manager.
 *
 * Supported boards and shields:
 * - Arduino 101 (recommended)
 * - RedBearLab BLE Shield (v2)  ** to be verified **
 * - RedBearLab BLE Nano ** works with modifications **
 *
 *================================================================================================*/

// change this to a unique name per board if running StandardFirmataBLE on multiple boards
// within the same physical space
#define FIRMATA_BLE_LOCAL_NAME "FIRMATA"

/*
 * RedBearLab BLE Shield
 *
 * If you are using a RedBearLab BLE shield, uncomment the define below.
 * Also, change the define for BLE_RST if you have the jumper set to pin 7 rather than pin 4.
 *
 * You will need to use the shield with an Arduino Zero, Due, Mega, or other board with sufficient
 * Flash and RAM. Arduino Uno, Leonardo and other ATmega328p and Atmega32u4 boards to not have
 * enough memory to run StandardFirmataBLE.
 *
 * TODO: verify if this works and with which boards it works.
