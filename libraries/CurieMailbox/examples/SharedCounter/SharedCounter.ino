/*
 * CurieMailbox: Shared Counter example
 *
 * Requires sample Zephyr application CurieMailbox_SharedCounter running on x86
 * core (get it from https://github.com/01org/CODK-M-X86-Samples)
 *
 * This example demonstrates sharing a single integer value between the x86
 * and ARC core. This sketch (ARC core) starts by sending a value of 0 using
 * CurieMailbox.put(). This is received by the application running on the x86
 * core, which increments the value by 1 and sends it back via the mailbox.
 *
 * This sketch will read the reply, and again increment it by one and send
 * it back to the x86 core through the mailbox. In this way the count value
 * will increase indefinitely, with each core performing alternate increments
 * and using the mailbox to pass the value in between.
