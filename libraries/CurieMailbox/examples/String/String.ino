/*
 * CurieMailbox: String example
 *
 * Requires sample Zephyr application CurieMailbox_String running on x86 core
 * (Get it from https://github.com/01org/CODK-M-X86-Samples)
 *
 * This example demonstrates sending a short (< 16 chars) string from the x86
 * core to the ARC core. The sketch below enables mailbox channnel 0 for
 * receiving messages, and for each received message prints out the channel
 * payload as a string of ASCII characters.
