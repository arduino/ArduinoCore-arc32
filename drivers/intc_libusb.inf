; ======== libusb 1.0 (WinUSB) device driver ==========
;
; To customize this inf file for your own device
;
; 1. Change "DeviceName" with the name you want your device to appear with 
;    on your system.
;
; 2. Change "VendorID" and "ProductID" according to those of your device. 
;    If your device is plugged in, you can retrieve these values through the 
;    Device Manager (regardless of whether the driver is installed or not).
;
; 3. Change "DeviceGUID" to a value that is unique on your system. For more 
;    information and tools to help you generate your own GUIDs, see 
;    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier.
;
; 4. Change "DeviceClassGUID" to reflect your USB Device Class. 
;    The following Device Classes are listed for reference:
;    {745a17a0-74d3-11d0-b6fe-00a0c90f57da} : HID device
;    {78a1c341-4539-11d3-b88d-00c04fad5171} : Generic WinUSB device
;
; 5. (Optional) Change the "Date" string.
;
; Note 1: if you need to create a matching cat file for this inf, you can use
; the inf2cat utility from the WinDDK, with the the following command:
; inf2cat /driver:"path_to_your inf" /os:7_X86,7_X64,Vista_X86,Vista_X64
;
; Note 2: The co-installers provided in these files are version 1.9.
